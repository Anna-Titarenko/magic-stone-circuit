# magic-stone-circuit

Its a fun project.

Once I have enthusiastically studied the origins of computer engineering, circuitry, and semiconductor physics. It was an interesting experience that is very different from high-level programming. For me, it was more of a fun than a professional hobby.

In my most cherished dreams, I really wanted to be a pioneer. Create the first transitors. The first logic circuits. The first computers. The first programs.

I decided to try to make a computer game about logic circuits. It will have other laws of physics, which, with a certain imagination, will give me the opportunity to consider myself as a pioneer.

## development
